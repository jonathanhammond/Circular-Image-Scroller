Continuous Circular Image Scrolling
=======================

Continuous circular image scrolling example for Quartz Composer and Origami http://origami.facebook.com

Results of a full day working with Origami, this composition shows a circular scrolling mechanism with rubber tension, magnet forces and snapping at boundaries.
Feedback on how I could have used Origami more extensively welcome.

Look in the composition for notes on bugs I found with the interaction2/layer patch and masks
