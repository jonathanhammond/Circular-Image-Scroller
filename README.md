Disk Image Scroller
=======================

Continuous disk image scrolling example for Quartz Composer and Origami http://origami.facebook.com

My first full day working with Facebooks additions to Quartz Composer for mobile UI/UX development

This composition shows how to use a circular scrolling mechanism with rubber tension, magnet forces and snapping at boundaries.

Look in the composition for notes on bugs I found with the interaction2/layer patch and masks
